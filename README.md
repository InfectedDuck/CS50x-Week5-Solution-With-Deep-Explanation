### ⭐️ **Star this repository! It really motivates me to make better explanations and produce more work!!** ⭐️

## Overview

This repository contains several C programs that implement different functionalities and algorithms:

1. `inheritance.c` - A program that simulates genetic inheritance of blood types.
2. `speller.c` - A program that implements a spell checker using a hash table.
3. `dictionary.c` - A program that provides dictionary functionalities using a hash table.

## Description

### 1. `inheritance.c`

#### Purpose

The `inheritance.c` program simulates the inheritance of blood types through multiple generations. It constructs a family tree and assigns blood type alleles randomly.

#### How it Works

1. Creates a family tree with a specified number of generations.
2. Randomly assigns blood type alleles to individuals.
3. Prints the family tree with the assigned blood types.

#### Key Points

- Simulates genetic inheritance using random allele assignment.
- Constructs and displays a family tree structure.
- Utilizes basic data structures and random number generation.

### 2. `speller.c`

#### Purpose

The `speller.c` program implements a spell checker that uses a hash table to check if words are correctly spelled based on a dictionary. It also benchmarks various operations.

#### How it Works

1. Loads a dictionary into memory using a hash table.
2. Reads and checks each word in the input text file.
3. Reports misspelled words and provides benchmarking results.

#### Key Points

- Utilizes hash table for efficient word checking.
- Benchmarks dictionary loading, word checking, and unloading.
- Handles file input/output and memory management.

### 3. `dictionary.c`

#### Purpose

The `dictionary.c` program implements basic dictionary functionalities using a hash table. It includes operations to load, check, size, and unload a dictionary.

#### How it Works

1. Loads words from a dictionary file into a hash table.
2. Provides functionality to check if words are in the dictionary.
3. Calculates the number of words and unloads the dictionary from memory.

#### Key Points

- Implements hash table for dictionary operations.
- Handles file reading and memory management.
- Provides essential dictionary functionalities.
